The goal of Twitter Debate is to present the current conversation on political topics. Users can select political candidates and topics (such as environment or health care), and view tweets by these candidates on those topics. The tweets are displayed side by side so as to have the appearance of a debate. This allows users to concisely read opposing viewpoints of a topic.

Project Assignment:
"The 2012 elections will be debated on the stump but also in social media.  This system will look to Twitter to gather viewpoints from, initially, politicians competing for a nomination or an office, and provide context for these tweets by organizing them by topic - for example, how to reduce the deficit, and setting them against each other.  The system has the visual appearance of debate."
